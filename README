- How to help us finding bugs and learning more about different models
  of the MPIO mp3 players?

The mpiosh shell is at the moment the only user interface to access
the functionality of libmpio. Because this software is definitly not
ready yet (pre alpha) and we need a lot of more information about
different models of the MPIO mp3 players we add special debugging
functionality to shell to help users to support our work.

To activate and to control the debugging output we need to understand
your bug reports the shell has a special 'debug' command. To activate
the debug ouput type the following command:

  mpio <i> debug on

to see more detailed deug output the level can be changed using the 'level' option like this:

  mpio <i> debug level 5

This sets the highest debug level available. To make it easier to send us the output you can redirect the debug output to a file like this:

  mpio <i> debug file /tmp/mpio-5.debug

If you would like to help us finding bugs and learning more about the
protocol of the MPIO players use this debugging support.

Thanks for you help.
