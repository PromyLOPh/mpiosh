  A library for handling ID3 tags

 When I was starting to write this library MP3 and music was the
lattest killerapp on the internet everybody was talking about. Napster
was the most dominating file sharing tool and the first portable mp3
players came out ready to be bought by the new tech-friendly .COM
people.

 It's been a few years since that and mplib got stable and the MP3
format is still arround, allthough beeing declared death by many. You
can't stop the revolution. While I was enjoying and discoverying new
bands and sounds I decided to give something in return, not to the big
mayor labels, but the MP3 community. And yes, I'm still buying CDs
though, more than ever.

 Mplib is written to be very easy to use,  fast, cross-platform 
capable and small size when shipped with other applications. It's currently
only able to handle common tag fields like artist, comment, etc. out of the
box. I'll include support for more special Id3 fields in v2 tags from
contributors if anyone sends me the nessecarry code. I'm just to lazy
to implement all the 70 frame types (type of informations you can include in a
v2 tag) just on chance somebody could use some of them. If you
think you need to store urgently a 'Musician credit list' or 'Event
timing codes' write me and I will hack you the code if I have the time
for it.

 And yeah, theres a allready a library written by the people who are
responsible for the ID3 standard, consider to use id3lib if you don't
like mplib :-P

 You should start with a short introduction on the API and usage of
mplib  you'll find in the download section of the sourceforge project
page. As I wrote above, it was important for me that this libarary is
easy to use, because I think the reading a artist name from a mp3 file
should really not be a big deal.

Enjoy mplib and send me some feedback,
